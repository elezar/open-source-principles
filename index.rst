Vision
======

We believe that open source software strongly benefits the tech community,
and that providing broadly useful code to the world is a virtue.
We strive to work in an open source way to the benefit of Zalando and the world.

Principles
==========

* **Do “Open Source First”**: If your Zalando project can be useful to non-Zalandos as well, release it as open-source from the start.
* **Take Ownership**: Your team is responsible for ensuring that it’s possible to open source your project. Your delivery lead is available for guidance.
* **Share Your Code**: All code shared between teams must be open source.
* **Be Safe**: Use :ref:`mit_license` only to ensure the most broad possible use of our software.
* **Deliver Quality**: Provide a great out of the box experience.
* **Provide Documentation**: Include a clear README and default working configuration.
* **Stay Secure**: Make sure your project doesn’t include Zalando specifics, such as credentials and private identifiers.
* **Ask for Help**: Find colleagues to brainstorm your project and review your work.
* **Promote**: Tell the world about your projects via blog posts, social media and conference talks.
* **Join the Open Source Guild**: You are invited to help us make open source stronger at Zalando!
